# Lua-Raytracer
This is a Raytracer made in lua that utilizes object oriented programming
It can create 3D spheres utilizing diffused shading and metalic surfaces that imulate refelction. 

3D scenes are rendered into a ppm file as output.

Run the main.lua script to implement the Raytracer. The program will the user to either run a preset 3D scene:
  type in the response 'y' or 'yes' if you want to run it or 'n' or 'no'. 
  
If you say no, then you will get the ability to set up the camera look-at point, field of view angle, and the position of a white light light source the scene. After setting up the camera the script will then prompt you for more input commands. overall I implemented 4 functions: draw, sphere, clear, and exit

this is the output of the preset scene
